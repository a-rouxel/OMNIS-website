# Alignment

## AOM 

The position and, most importantly, the angles between the incident beam and the AOM are critical as they strongly influence the energy efficiency of the 1th diffraction order.

To align, we use the manual 3D translation stage to adjust XYZ position so the laser beam passes through approximately at the center. Then, to adjust the angle between AOM and laser beam, we use both the screws that fix the translation stage to the optical table (for coarse adjustement) then the screws that fix the AOM to the translation stage (for small adjustments).

Once the alignment is OK, we should obtain around 85% transmission for the 1st order and 5V input voltage into the AOM (cf .subsytem page)

## Pinhole - P1

Pinhole P1 is used to keep only the 1st diffraction order of the AOM, the other orders are cleared out. One way
