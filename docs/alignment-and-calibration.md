# Alignment and Calibration

## AOM

The position and, most importantly, the angles between the incident beam and the AOM are critical as they strongly influence the energy efficiency of the 1th diffraction order

## Initial Alignment

_TODO: Describe the initial alignment procedure for the OMNIS system._

## Calibration Procedure

_TODO: Describe the step-by-step calibration procedure._

## Troubleshooting

_TODO: List common issues and their solutions._
