# OMNIS — Optical Mesoscale Neural Interrogation System

## Overview

![OMNIS Stimulation Scheme](images/SCHEME_stimulation.svg)

OMNIS is a platform designed to adress fundamental neuroscience questions : How does information flow between cortical regions during decision-making ? How does consciousness reflect on neural activity ? 

We present a platform combining scanning light-field microscopy, and holographic stimulation to enable chronic multi-region neural circuit interrogation at mesoscopic scales and single at single-cell resolution.

The main advantages of this platform :
- 6 x 5 x 0.3 mm3 adressable volume for both imaging and stimulation, enabling multi-region experiments
- Low photoxicity, enabling long term studies


## Subsystems

### FOR EXPERIMENT
- laser : 1040 nm femto second laser from Fatonics 
- AOM : ?
- SLM: HSP1920-850-1650-HSP8 from Meadowlark Optics
- Spiral galvanometer : 7mm aperture for Cambridge Technology
- Field galvanometer : 20 mm aperture from Sino-Galvo
- Scanning Light-Field Microscope (refered to as a single subsytem here)

### EXTRA FOR CALIBRATION
- monochrome sensor : 4032x3036 pixels with 1.85 um pixel size
- 3D translation stages : 50 mm range for Lubang -  3x EM-LSS65-50C1

## Alignment

### AOM

The position and, most importantly, the angles between the incident beam and the AOM are critical as they strongly influence the energy efficiency of the 1th diffraction order
